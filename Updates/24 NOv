Authentication Module Completion
Today, we successfully completed the development of the authentication module. This module now incorporates JWT authentication with a simple symmetric key.
Key Features Implemented:
 * JWT Token Generation and Validation: We have implemented robust mechanisms for generating and validating JWT tokens.
 * Token Storage and Retrieval:
   * Login Requests: JWT tokens are stored as cookies to facilitate seamless user experience.
   * Signed Requests: JWT tokens are included in request headers for secure authorization.
 * User Authentication: The module ensures secure user authentication by verifying token validity and integrity.
Upcoming Tasks: Order Profile Module
Starting from tomorrow, we will focus on developing the order profile module. This module will enable users to manage their orders efficiently.
Key Objectives:
 * Order Creation and Management: Users should be able to create, view, and modify their orders.
 * Order Tracking: Real-time order tracking and status updates will be implemented.
 * Payment Integration: Secure payment gateways will be integrated for seamless transactions.
 * Order History: Users should be able to access their past order history.
By completing these tasks, we will significantly enhance the platform's functionality and user experience.
