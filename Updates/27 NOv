Order Module
 * Order Placement: The order placement functionality has been successfully implemented. Users can now place orders seamlessly.
 * Order Cancellation: We are currently in the process of developing the order cancellation module. This feature will allow users to cancel orders under certain conditions.
 * Invoice Generation: We plan to generate invoices in PDF format, ensuring easy accessibility and distribution to clients. We're exploring the use of ChatGPT to assist in automating certain aspects of the invoice generation process.
Upcoming Features
 * Invoice Model: Tomorrow, we will complete the development of the Invoice Model. This model will be integrated into the transactional management system for orders.
 * Independent Invoice Controller: We will also create an independent controller for the Invoice module to handle specific invoice-related operations.
